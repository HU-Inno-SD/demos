# Everything Docker!

This repository contains brain dumps and examples on how to use Docker and docker-compose.  
They can be used as a start-off point for using them and as cheat-sheets for when you're stuck on something.

If you are new to Docker, I'd recommend to start with Docker first and then move on to docker-compose.
