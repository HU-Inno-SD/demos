> There is a chance that installing Docker soft-bricks your Windows system. Causing a BSOD on system startup.  
> This has happened in the past and there have been multiple people [reporting this on the official Github repository.](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/1549)
> 
> It is recommended to make sure you have a sufficient back-up of important files **BEFORE** installing Docker.  
> Make sure your BIOS and OS are up-to-date before installing.
> 
> If you run into any issues, please contact your lecturer ASAP.  
> Be careful before proceeding with system recovery etc.  
> This may make the issue worse.  
> Booting in safe-mode and uninstalling the software may resolve the BSOD. Otherwise, a re-installation of your OS might be necessary. 
> 
> If you cannot afford to spend time in order to restore your system in case of a failure. Please don't take the risk.

This repository contains brain dumps and examples on how to use Docker and docker-compose.  
They can be used as a start-off point for using them and as cheat-sheets for when you're stuck on something.

If you are new to Docker, I'd recommend to start with Docker first and then move on to docker-compose.
